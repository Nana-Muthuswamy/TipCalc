# Pre-work - TipCalc

TipCalc is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: Narayanan (Nana) Muthuswamy

Time spent: Approximately 10 to 12 hours spent in total. Note: Some days I worked over 2 hours and some days I did not work at all, based on my work load. But on an average, I spent 2 hours a day last 5-6 days.

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [√] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.
* [√] Settings page to change the default tip percentage.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [√] UI animations
* [ ] Remembering the bill amount across app restarts (if <10mins)
* [ ] Using locale-specific currency and currency thousands separators.
* [√] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.
Note: I will be implementing the above two leftout features post submission.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [√] Introduced a new feature to Merge or Split the totals and its configurable.
- [√] The entire UI layout is constructed using UIStackViews and Autolayouts. Thus, rendering the layout consistently irrespective of iPhone sizes.
- [√] Included comic cartoon characters just to bring some lighter mood! :)

## Notes

Though I'm a seasoned macOS developer @ Apple Inc., I'm pretty new to iOS Swift programing. I did most of the work using Swift 3.0 iBook and programming guides available @ developer.apple.com. UIStackViews and StoryBoard concepts are very simple but it required sometime for me to get the rhythm. I thoroughly enjoyed the time spent on this pre-work. I'm looking forward to contribute more to this app and start developing more iOS apps using Swift. Thats my new year's resolution...!
